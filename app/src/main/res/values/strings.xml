    <string name="lorem">Application Called J-Diary. It has 2 main functions - Notes and Reminders. We can add notes, edit them and delete. We also can add Reminders, edit them and delete as we wish. At first users must register. Only then they will be able to use the app. The app is easy to use and its design is clear to everyone. The application has been created by Greta Tepanyan(Student in Samsung Innovation Campus). As a database i used firebase. The app icons taken from Flaticon. I hope you liked the application.
